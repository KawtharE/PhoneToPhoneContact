# Call or Text Message
Make a phone call or send a text message to a mobile phone.

It is all about extending BroadcastReciever and using TelephonyManager to figure out the type and the state of the phone call: Incoming or Outgoing, ringing, connected ....                                                                            SmsManager to send a text message.                                                                                             A navigation Menu to make the choice!

Nothing is simplier!!
