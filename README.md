# PhoneToPhoneContact
Make a phone call or send a text message to a mobile phone.

It is all about extending BroadcastReciever and using TelephonyManager to figure out the type and the state of the phone call: Incoming or Outgoing, ringing, connected .... \n SmsManager to send a text message.\n
A navigation Menu to make the choice!\n

Nothing is simplier!!
